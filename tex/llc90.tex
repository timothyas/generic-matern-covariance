Here we describe the LLC90 grid

\noindent\textbf{Samples from the covariance model.}

%        model.
%        (top row) Samples from the covariance model, normalized by the
%        pointwise standard deviation. Each column shows increasing correlation
%        length scales, which is regulated by $\rangeh$.
%        The arrows in the bottom right corner of each plot show the approximate length scales
%        that are covered by $\rangeh L_y$ and $\rangeh L_z$, respectively.
%        Here we have used $L_y = 2\Delta y_g$ and $L_z=\Delta r_f$, see
%        Figure \ref{fig:mitgcm_grid} for a notational reference.
%        We note that the standard normal vector $\mathbf{z}$ is unique in
%        each figure.
%        (bottom row) Pointwise standard deviation of the covariance operator
%        $CC^T$, estimated from
%        a sample size of $N=1000$. The diagonal matrix $X$ is comprised of the
%        inverse of this field.

\noindent\textbf{Correlation length scales.}

Here we do not use the Jacobian, but just compute based on neighboring grid
cells.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/llc90_nondimensional_correlation_k.pdf}
    \caption{Correlation coefficient using the LLC90 (global ocean) grid, with
        distances computed in the vertical dimension from 100 samples. The coefficient is
        computed from the random samples used to estimate
        $\hat{\sigma}$ and $X$. Each color denotes correlations computed for a
        different value of $\rangeh$, and the spread is determined by one standard
        deviation around the domain averaged correlation coefficent.
        The black curve denotes the predicted isotropic correlation predicted by
        equation \eqref{eq:matern_correlation_iso} with the appropriate value for
        $\rangeh$.}
