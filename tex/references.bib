While many previous studies rely on severe hypotheses (assuming stationarity of the flow and/or neglecting diffusion) to evaluate the residence time, the paper introduces a general method for computing the residence time and/or the mean residence time without such simplifying hypotheses. The method is based on the resolution of an adjoint advection–diffusion problem and is therefore primarily meant to be used with numerical models. The method and its implications are first introduced using a simplified one-dimensional analytical model. The approach is then applied to the diagnostic of the three-dimensional circulation on the Northwest European Continental Shelf.},

	abstract = {The concepts of age, residence time, exposure time and influence time provide space and time dependent quantitative measures of the rate at which water masses and pollutants enter and/or leave a control domain. To help avoid confusion between these concepts, this paper provides clear definitions of the residence time and the influence time. The similarities and differences between them are illustrated using both a simplified 1D advection–diffusion model and a realistic two-dimensional model of the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). The residence time of a water parcel in a control domain is the time taken by this parcel to leave the control domain for the first time. The influence time is the time required to replace the water in the domain of interest by renewing water. For steady flows, the influence time is numerically identical to the age of the renewing water, but the two timescales differ for unsteady flows. The residence time measures the influence of a hypothetical point discharge on a control domain. In environmental studies, it provides a measure of the effectiveness of hydrodynamic processes at helping a semi-enclosed basin to recover from a local pollution event. The influence time quantifies the local influence of a tracer that would be uniformly distributed in the control domain at the initial time. It is therefore a relevant diagnostic tool in impact studies focusing on the local persistence of a pollution problem initially affecting a large domain.},

The age of a parcel of a constituent is defined to be the time elapsed since the parcel under consideration left the region where its age is prescribed to be zero. Estimating the age is an invaluable tool for understanding complex flows and the functioning of the numerical models used for representing them. A general theory of the age is developed, according to which the age of a constituent of seawater is a time-dependent, pointwise quantity that may be obtained from the solution of two partial differential equations governing the evolution of the concentration of the constituent under study and an auxiliary variable called the ``age concentration''. It is seen that previous applications of the notion of age are in agreement with the present theory, or may be viewed as approximations deriving from this theory. A few particular problems are touched upon, including the estimation of the age of the water and the determination of the age with the help of radioactive tracers.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies play a substantial role in the dynamics of the ocean, but the dominant length-scale of these eddies varies greatly with latitude, stratification and ocean depth. Global numerical ocean models with spatial resolutions ranging from 1° down to just a few kilometers include both regions where the dominant eddy scales are well resolved and regions where the model’s resolution is too coarse for the eddies to form, and hence eddy effects need to be parameterized. However, common parameterizations of eddy effects via a Laplacian diffusion of the height of isopycnal surfaces (a Gent–McWilliams diffusivity) are much more effective at suppressing resolved eddies than in replicating their effects. A variant of the Phillips model of baroclinic instability illustrates how eddy effects might be represented in ocean models. The ratio of the first baroclinic deformation radius to the horizontal grid spacing indicates where an ocean model could explicitly simulate eddy effects; a function of this ratio can be used to specify where eddy effects are parameterized and where they are explicitly modeled. One viable approach is to abruptly disable all the eddy parameterizations once the deformation radius is adequately resolved; at the discontinuity where the parameterization is disabled, isopycnal heights are locally flattened on the one side while eddies grow rapidly off of the enhanced slopes on the other side, such that the total parameterized and eddy fluxes vary continuously at the discontinuity in the diffusivity. This approach should work well with various specifications for the magnitude of the eddy diffusivities.},

Data used include Argo float profiles, CTD synoptic sections, Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS) instrument-mounted seal profiles, XBTs, altimetric observations [Envisat, Geosat, Jason-1, and Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon], and infrared and microwave radiometer observed sea surface temperature. An adjoint model is used to determine descent directions in minimizing a misfit function, each of whose elements has been weighted by an estimate of the observational plus model error. The model is brought into near agreement with the data by adjusting its control vector, here consisting of initial and meteorological boundary conditions. Although total consistency has not yet been achieved, the existing solution is in good agreement with the great majority of the 2005 and 2006 Southern Ocean observations and better represents these data than does the World Ocean Atlas 2001 (WOA01) climatological product. The estimate captures the oceanic temporal variability and in this respect represents a major improvement upon earlier static inverse estimates. During the estimation period, the Drake Passage volume transport is 153 ± 5 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1). The Ross and Weddell polar gyre transports are 20 ± 5 Sv and 40 ± 8 Sv, respectively. Across 32°S there is a surface meridional overturning cell of 12 ± 12 Sv, an intermediate cell of 17 ± 12 Sv, and an abyssal cell of 13 ± 6 Sv. The northward heat and freshwater anomaly transports across 30°S are −0.3 PW and 0.7 Sv, with estimated uncertainties of 0.5 PW and 0.2 Sv. The net rate of wind work is 2.1 ± 1.1 TW. Southern Ocean theories involving short temporal- and spatial-scale dynamics may now be tested with a dynamically and thermodynamically realistic general circulation model solution that is known to be compatible with the modern observational datasets.},

	abstract = {A description and assessment of the first release of the Arctic Subpolar gyre sTate Estimate (ASTE\_R1), a data-constrained ocean-sea ice model-data synthesis, is presented. ASTE\_R1 has a nominal resolution of 1/3° and spans the period 2002–2017. The fit of the model to an extensive (O(109)) set of satellite and in situ observations was achieved through adjoint-based nonlinear least squares optimization. The improvement of the solution compared to an unconstrained simulation is reflected in misfit reductions of 77\% for Argo, 50\% for satellite sea surface height, 58\% for the Fram Strait mooring, 65\% for Ice Tethered Profilers, and 83\% for sea ice extent. Exact dynamical and kinematic consistency is a key advantage of ASTE\_R1, distinguishing the state estimate from existing ocean reanalyses. Through strict adherence to conservation laws, all sources and sinks within ASTE\_R1 can be accounted for, permitting meaningful analysis of closed budgets at the grid-scale, such as contributions of horizontal and vertical convergence to the tendencies of heat and salt. ASTE\_R1 thus serves as the biggest effort undertaken to date of producing a specialized Arctic ocean-ice estimate over the 21st century. Transports of volume, heat, and freshwater are consistent with published observation-based estimates across important Arctic Mediterranean gateways. Interannual variability and low frequency trends of freshwater and heat content are well represented in the Barents Sea, western Arctic halocline, and east subpolar North Atlantic. Systematic biases remain in ASTE\_R1, including a warm bias in the Atlantic Water layer in the Arctic and deficient freshwater inputs from rivers and Greenland discharge.},

We show here that these properties can be achieved in practice through use of a rescaled vertical coordinate “z∗” in z-coordinate models that allows one to follow undulations in the free-surface under sea ice loading. In particular, the adoption of “z∗” avoids the difficult issue of vanishing levels under thick ice. Details of the implementation within MITgcm are provided. A high resolution global ocean sea ice simulation illustrates the robustness of the z∗ formulation and reveals a source of oceanic variability associated with sea ice dynamics and ice-loading effects. The use of the z∗ coordinate allows one to achieve perfect conservation of fresh water, heat and salt, as shown in extended integration of coupled ocean sea ice atmospheric model.},

	abstract = {The critical role played by observations during ocean data assimilation was explored when the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system was applied sequentially to the California Current circulation. The adjoint of the 4D-Var gain matrix was used to quantify the impact of individual observations and observation platforms on different aspects of the 4D-Var circulation estimates during both analysis and subsequent forecast cycles. In this study we focus on the alongshore and cross-shore transport of the California Current System associated with wind-induced coastal upwelling along the central California coast. The majority of the observations available during any given analysis cycle are from satellite platforms in the form of SST and SSH, and on average these data exert the largest controlling influence on the analysis increments and forecast skill of coastal transport. However, subsurface in situ observations from Argo floats, CTDs, XBTs and tagged marine mammals often have a considerable impact on analyses and forecasts of coastal transport, even though these observations represent a relatively small fraction of the available data at any particular time. During 4D-Var the observations are used to correct for uncertainties in the model control variables, namely the initial conditions, surface forcing, and open boundary conditions. It is found that correcting for uncertainties in both the initial conditions and surface forcing has the largest impact on the analysis increments in alongshore transport, while the cross-shore transport is controlled mainly by the surface forcing. The memory of the circulation associated with the control variable increments was also explored in relation to 7day forecasts of the coastal circulation. Despite the importance of correcting for surface forcing uncertainties during analysis cycles, the coastal transport during forecast cycles initialized from the analyses has less memory of the surface forcing corrections, and is controlled primarily by the analysis initial conditions. Using the adjoint of the entire 4D-Var system we have also explored the sensitivity of the coastal transport to changes in the observations and the observation array. A single integration of the adjoint of 4D-Var can be used to predict the change that occurs when observations from different platforms are omitted from the 4D-Var analysis. Thus observing system experiments can be performed for each data assimilation cycle at a fraction of the computational cost that would be required to repeat the 4D-Var analyses when observations are withheld. This is the third part of a three part series describing the ROMS 4D-Var systems.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation is now used routinely in oceanography on both regional and global scales for computing ocean circulation estimates and for making ocean forecasts. Regional ocean observing systems are also expanding rapidly, and observations from a wide array of different platforms and sensor types are now available. Evaluation of the impact of the observing system on ocean circulation estimates (and forecasts) is therefore of considerable interest to the oceanographic community. In this paper, we quantify the impact of different observing platforms on estimates of the California Current System (CCS) spanning a three decade period (1980–2010). Specifically, we focus attention on several dynamically related aspects of the circulation (coastal upwelling, the transport of the California Current and the California Undercurrent, thermocline depth and eddy kinetic energy) which in many ways describe defining characteristics of the CCS. The circulation estimates were computed using a 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system, and our analyses also focus on the impact of the different elements of the control vector (i.e. the initial conditions, surface forcing, and open boundary conditions) on the circulation. While the influence of each component of the control vector varies between different metrics of the circulation, the impact of each observing system across metrics is very robust. In addition, the mean amplitude of the circulation increments (i.e. the difference between the analysis and background) remains relatively stable throughout the three decade period despite the addition of new observing platforms whose impact is redistributed according to the relative uncertainty of observations from each platform. We also consider the impact of each observing platform on CCS circulation variability associated with low-frequency climate variability. The low-frequency nature of the dominant climate modes in this region allows us to track through time the impact of each observation on the circulation, and illustrates how observations from some platforms can influence the circulation up to a decade into the future.},

RAMs are an extension of the original formulation of array modes introduced by Bennett (1985) but in the reduced model state-space explored by the 4D-Var system, and reveal the extent to which this space is activated by the observations. The projection of the RAMs onto the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the 4D-Var background error correlation matrix provides a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of the measurements in observing the circulation. It is found that much of the space spanned by the background error covariance is unconstrained by the present ocean observing system. The RAM spectrum is also used to introduce a new criterion to prevent 4D-Var from overfitting the model to the observations.},

In the case of the CCS, experiments were performed using synthetic observations, so-called Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). An extensive suite of CCS OSSEs were conducted to explore the performance of both data assimilation approaches to system configuration. For the EAKF, this includes the method for generating the seed ensemble, ensemble size, localization scales, and the length of the assimilation window. In the case of 4D-Var, the influence of assimilation window length, and the formulation of the background error covariance were explored. The performance of the EAKF was found to be influenced most by the size of the ensemble and by the method used to generate the initial seed ensemble where centering of the ensemble was found to yield improvement. For 4D-Var, the assimilation window length is by far the most critical factor, with an increase in system performance as the window length is extended. In general, the EAKF and 4D-Var systems converge to similar solutions over time, which are independent of the starting point. The EAKF employs a First-Guess at Appropriate Time (FGAT) strategy, and some experiments indicate that short FGAT windows can be problematic due to the introduction of frequent initialization shocks. While the EAKF generally out-performs 4D-Var in the OSSEs, analysis of the innovations from the two systems through time indicates that they track each other closely. Additional Observing System Experiments (OSEs) were performed in the CCS and IO configurations of ROMS using real ocean observations. In this case, the comparison of the EAKF and 4D-Var state estimates with independent observations indicates that the EAKF and 4D-Var state estimates diverge over time, although the 4D-Var estimates are somewhat better by some measures. The relative performance of the EAKF and 4D-Var systems is similar across the wide-range circulation regimes that characterize the CCS and IO, suggesting that the results presented here are a robust indicator of expected performance in other regions of the world ocean.},

	abstract = {We study the impact of synthesizing ocean and sea ice concentration data with a global, eddying coupled sea ice-ocean configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model with the goal of reproducing the 2004 three-dimensional time-evolving ice-ocean state. This work builds on the state estimation framework developed in the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean consortium by seeking a reconstruction of the global sea ice-ocean system that is simultaneously consistent with (1) a suite of in situ and remotely-sensed ocean and ice data and (2) the physics encoded in the numerical model. This dual consistency is successfully achieved here by adjusting only the model's initial hydrographic state and its atmospheric boundary conditions such that misfits between the model and data are minimized in a least-squares sense. We show that synthesizing both ocean and sea ice concentration data is required for the model to adequately reproduce the observed details of the sea ice annual cycle in both hemispheres. Surprisingly, only modest adjustments to our first-guess atmospheric state and ocean initial conditions are necessary to achieve model-data consistency, suggesting that atmospheric reanalysis products remain a leading source of errors for sea ice-ocean model hindcasts and reanalyses. The synthesis of sea ice data is found to ameliorate misfits in the high latitude ocean, especially with respect to upper ocean stratification, temperature, and salinity. Constraining the model to sea ice concentration modestly reduces ICESat-derived Arctic ice thickness errors by improving the temporal and spatial evolution of seasonal ice. Further increases in the accuracy of global sea ice thickness in the model likely require the direct synthesis of sea ice thickness data.},

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best‐fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.}

It is a convenient graphical tool for displaying the trade-off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data, as the regularization parameter varies. The L-curve thus gives insight into the regularizing properties of the underlying regularization method, and it is an aid in choosing an appropriate regularization parameter for the given data. In this chapter we summarize the main properties of the L-curve, and demonstrate by examples its usefulness and its limitations both as an analysis tool and as a method for choosing the regularization parameter.  1 Introduction  Practically all regularization methods for computing stable solutions to inverse problems involve a trade-off between the "size" of the regularized solution and the quality of the fit that it provides to the given data.

The rate at which algorithms for computing the best fit to data converge depends on the size of the condition number and the distribution of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which contains the second derivatives of this quadratic function. The inverse of the Hessian can be identified as the covariance matrix that establishes the accuracy to which the model state is determined by the data; the reciprocals of the Hessian's eigenvalues represent the variances of linear combinations of variables determined by its eigenvectors. The aspect of the model state that are most difficult to compute are those about which the data provide the least information. A unified formalism is presented in which the model may be treated as providing either strong or weak constraints, and methods for computing and inverting the Hessian matrix are discussed.

	abstract = {The ultimate purpose of most computational models is to make predictions, commonly in support of some decision-making process (e.g., for design or operation of some system). The quantities that need to be predicted (the quantities of interest or QoIs) are generally not experimentally observable before the prediction, since otherwise no prediction would be needed. Assessing the validity of such extrapolative predictions, which is critical to informed decision-making, is challenging. In classical approaches to validation, model outputs for observed quantities are compared to observations to determine if they are consistent. By itself, this consistency only ensures that the model can predict the observed quantities under the conditions of the observations. This limitation dramatically reduces the utility of the validation effort for decision making because it implies nothing about predictions of unobserved QoIs or for scenarios outside of the range of observations. However, there is no agreement in the scientific community today regarding best practices for validation of extrapolative predictions made using computational models. The purpose of this paper is to propose and explore a validation and predictive assessment process that supports extrapolative predictions for models with known sources of error. The process includes stochastic modeling, calibration, validation, and predictive assessment phases where representations of known sources of uncertainty and error are built, informed, and tested. The proposed methodology is applied to an illustrative extrapolation problem involving a misspecified nonlinear oscillator.},

	abstract = {We have seen that the consideration and quantification of uncertainty in computational predictions introduce new challenges to the processes of calibration and validation of mathematical models and their use in making predictions. In calibration, uncertainties in experimental observations and uncertainties arising from inadequacies or randomness in the mathematical models must be accounted for to obtain estimates of input parameters and their uncertainties. The validation process is designed to challenge the models in their ability to predict the quantities of interest, and must account for the uncertainty of the observations and of the model and its parameters. Finally, issuing predictions of the quantities of interest involves estimating the QoI’s and their uncertainties given the uncertainties in models and inputs. These uncertainty considerations require a mathematical representation of uncertainty, and we argue that probability in the context of Bayesian statistics provides a particularly powerful representation. Many challenges remain, however, for the development of new or improved conceptual and computational tools needed to treat uncertainty in computational simulations of complex systems. Among the challenges are representing model inadequacy, characterizing the usefulness of particular validation tests, determining the consequences of validation comparisons on the quantities of interest, posing validation metrics that are appropriate in various situations, and devising efficient algorithms for the required computations, especially when there are many uncertain parameters and the models are computationally expensive.},

	abstract = {Oceanic quantities of interest (QoIs), for example, ocean heat content or transports, are often inaccessible to direct observation, due to the high cost of instrument deployment and logistical challenges. Therefore, oceanographers seek proxies for undersampled or unobserved QoIs. Conventionally, proxy potential is assessed via statistical correlations, which measure covariability without establishing causality. This paper introduces an alternative method: quantifying dynamical proxy potential. Using an adjoint model, this method unambiguously identifies the physical origins of covariability. A North Atlantic case study illustrates our method within the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) state estimation framework. We find that wind forcing along the eastern and northern boundaries of the Atlantic drives a basin-wide response in North Atlantic circulation and temperature. Due to these large-scale teleconnections, a single subsurface temperature observation in the Irminger Sea informs heat transport across the remote Iceland-Scotland ridge (ISR), with a dynamical proxy potential of 19\%. Dynamical proxy potential allows two equivalent interpretations: Irminger Sea subsurface temperature (i) shares 19\% of its adjustment physics with ISR heat transport and (ii) reduces the uncertainty in ISR heat transport by 19\% (independent of the measured temperature value), if the Irminger Sea observation is added without noise to the ECCO state estimate. With its two interpretations, dynamical proxy potential is simultaneously rooted in (i) ocean dynamics and (ii) uncertainty quantification and optimal observing system design, the latter being an emerging branch in computational science. The new method may therefore foster dynamics-based, quantitative ocean observing system design in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification of groundwater (GW) aquifer parameters is critical for efficient management and sustainable extraction of GW resources. These uncertainties are introduced by the data, model, and prior information on the parameters. Here we develop a Bayesian inversion framework that uses Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) surface deformation data to infer the laterally heterogeneous permeability of a transient linear poroelastic model of a confined GW aquifer. The Bayesian solution of this inverse problem takes the form of a posterior probability density of the permeability. Exploring this posterior using classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is computationally prohibitive due to the large dimension of the discretized permeability field and the expense of solving the poroelastic forward problem. However, in many partial differential equation (PDE)-based Bayesian inversion problems, the data are only informative in a few directions in parameter space. For the poroelasticity problem, we prove this property theoretically for a one-dimensional problem and demonstrate it numerically for a three-dimensional aquifer model. We design a generalized preconditioned Crank--Nicolson (gpCN) MCMC method that exploits this intrinsic low dimensionality by using a low-rank based Laplace approximation of the posterior as a proposal, which we build scalably. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated through a real GW aquifer test in Nevada. The inherently two dimensional nature of InSAR surface deformation data informs a sufficient number of modes of the permeability field to allow detection of major structures within the aquifer, significantly reducing the uncertainty in the pressure and the displacement quantities of interest.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the properties of groundwater aquifers is essential for predicting aquifer response and managing groundwater resources. In this work, we develop a high-dimensional scalable Bayesian inversion framework governed by a three-dimensional quasi-static linear poroelastic model to characterize lateral permeability variations in groundwater aquifers. We determine the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point of the posterior permeability distribution from centimeter-level surface deformation measurements obtained from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). The scalability of our method to high parameter dimension is achieved through the use of adjoint-based derivatives, inexact Newton methods to determine the MAP point, and a Matérn class sparse prior precision operator. Together, these guarantee that the MAP point is found at a cost, measured in number of forward/adjoint poroelasticity solves, that is independent of the parameter dimension. We apply our methodology to a test case for a municipal well in Mesquite, Nevada, in which InSAR and GPS surface deformation data are available. We solve problems with up to 320,824 state variable degrees of freedom (DOFs) and 16,896 parameter DOFs. A consistent treatment of noise level is employed so that the aquifer characterization result does not depend on the pixel spacing of surface deformation data. Our results show that the use of InSAR data significantly improves characterization of lateral aquifer heterogeneity, and the InSAR-based aquifer characterization recovers complex lateral displacement trends observed by independent daily GPS measurements.},

	abstract = {Physical theories allow us to make predictions: given a complete description of a physical system, we can predict the outcome of some measurements. This problem of predicting the result of measurements is called the modelization problem, the simulation problem, or the forward problem. The inverse problem consists of using the actual result of some measurements to infer the values of the parameters that characterize the system. While the forward problem has (in deterministic physics) a unique solution, the inverse problem does not. As an example, consider measurements of the gravity field around a planet: given the distribution of mass inside the planet, we can uniquely predict the values of the gravity field around the planet (forward problem), but there are different distributions of mass that give exactly the same gravity field in the space outside the planet. Therefore, the inverse problem — of inferring the mass distribution from observations of the gravity field — has multiple solutions (in fact, an infinite number). Because of this, in the inverse problem, one needs tomake explicit any available a priori information on the model parameters. One also needs to be careful in the representation of the data uncertainties. The most general (and simple) theory is obtained when using a probabilistic point of view, where the a priori information on the model parameters is represented by a probability distribution over the ‘model space.’ The theory developed here explains how this a priori probability distribution is transformed into the a posteriori probability distribution, by incorporating a physical theory (relating the model parameters to some observable parameters) and the actual result of the observations (with their uncertainties). To develop the theory, we shall need to examine the different types of parameters that appear in physics and to be able to understand what a total absence of a priori information on a given parameter may mean. Although the notion of the inverse problem could be based on conditional probabilities and Bayes's theorem, I choose to introduce a more general notion, that of the ‘combination of states of information,’ that is, in principle, free from the special difficulties appearing in the use of conditional probability densities (like the well-known Borel paradox).},

This approach has been adopted primarily due to difficulties in the initialization of low-dimensional chaotic models, where the search for optimal initial conditions by gradient-descent algorithms is hampered by multiple local minima. Although initialization is an important task for numerical weather prediction, ocean state estimation usually demands an additional task \&ndash; a solution of the time-dependent surface boundary conditions that result from atmosphere\&ndash;ocean interaction. Here, we apply the Lagrange multiplier method to an analogous boundary control problem, tracking the trajectory of the forced chaotic pendulum. Contrary to previous assertions, it is demonstrated that the Lagrange multiplier method can track multiple chaotic transitions through time, so long as the boundary conditions render the system controllable. Thus, the nonlinear timescale poses no limit to the time interval for successful Lagrange multiplier-based estimation. That the key criterion is controllability, not a pure measure of dynamical stability or chaos, illustrates the similarities between the Lagrange multiplier method and other state estimation methods. The results with the chaotic pendulum suggest that nonlinearity should not be a fundamental obstacle to ocean state estimation with eddy-resolving models, especially when using an improved first-guess trajectory.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We propose a method for representing spatially correlated observation errors in variational data assimilation. The method is based on the numerical solution of a diffusion equation, a technique commonly used for representing spatially correlated background errors. The discretization of the pseudo-time derivative of the diffusion equation is done implicitly using a backward Euler scheme. The solution of the resulting elliptic equation can be interpreted as a correlation operator whose kernel is a correlation function from the Matérn family. In order to account for the possibly heterogeneous distribution of observations, a spatial discretization technique based on the finite element method (FEM) is chosen where the observation locations are used to define the nodes of an unstructured mesh on which the diffusion equation is solved. By construction, the method leads to a convenient operator for the inverse of the observation-error correlation matrix, which is an important requirement when applying it with standard minimization algorithms in variational data assimilation. Previous studies have shown that spatially correlated observation errors can also be accounted for by assimilating the observations together with their directional derivatives up to arbitrary order. In the continuous framework, we show that the two approaches are formally equivalent for certain parameter specifications. The FEM provides an appropriate framework for evaluating the derivatives numerically, especially when the observations are heterogeneously distributed. Numerical experiments are performed using a realistic data distribution from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI). Correlations obtained with the FEM-discretized diffusion operator are compared with those obtained using the analytical Matérn correlation model. The method is shown to produce an accurate representation of the target Matérn function in regions where the data are densely distributed. The presence of large gaps in the data distribution degrades the quality of the mesh and leads to numerical errors in the representation of the Matérn function. Strategies to improve the accuracy of the method in the presence of such gaps are discussed.},

	abstract = {Correlation models are required in data assimilation to characterize the error structures of variables defined on a numerical grid. Previous studies have shown that the diffusion equation can provide a flexible and computationally efficient framework for representing grid-point correlation functions for problems of large dimension such as those encountered in atmospheric or ocean variational data assimilation. In this article, an implicit formulation of the diffusion-based correlation model is presented as an alternative to the traditional explicit formulation. The implicit formulation is analyzed in detail for the one-dimensional (1D) problem and shown to be closely related to the first-order recursive filter. Integrating a 1D implicit diffusion equation, with constant coefficient, over M steps is shown to be equivalent to convolving the initial condition with an Mth order auto-regressive (AR) function. Expressions for both the length-scale of the AR function and the normalization factor required to generate unit-amplitude (correlation) functions are given in terms of M and the diffusion coefficient. For a fixed length-scale the Gaussian function, which is the only function that can be represented using an explicit formulation of the constant-coefficient diffusion equation, is the limiting case as M → ∞ of the AR functions generated by the implicit diffusion equation. Generalizations of the diffusion model are discussed to allow for different shapes in the correlation function and spatial variations in the length-scale. An important consequence of employing spatially varying length-scales is that the normalization factors are no longer constant. Approximate expressions for the normalization factors are evaluated in terms of their effectiveness to provide viable alternatives to estimates produced using expensive algorithms such as randomization. Boundary conditions can distort the correlation functions near the boundaries and significantly degrade the accuracy of the analytical expressions for the normalization factors. These problems can be avoided through a straightforward extension of the diffusion model that makes the boundaries effectively transparent, although the solution comes at the expense of an extra application of the diffusion equation. Extensions of the method to construct two- and three-dimensional correlation models are discussed. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},
