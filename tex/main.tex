    \item We derive a generic covariance model appropriate for anisotropic,
        nonstationary fields \red{This is the title...}
    \item The formulation presents a number of computational advantages compared
        to previous work, such as easy application of to both the covariance or
        precision operators (its inverse)

\begin{abstract}
    A key component of data assimilation methods is the specification of
    univariate spatial correlations, which appear in the background-error
    covariance.
    For realistic problems in meteorology and oceanography,
    correlation length scales are nonstationary (variable in space) and
    anisotropic (variable in each direction).
    Variational approaches typically use an operator to enforce correlation
    length scales, and thus the operator must be designed to capture
    desired levels of nonstationarity and anisotropy.
    For systems with complex boundaries, such as the ocean, it is natural
    to use a filtering approach based on the application of an elliptic,
    Laplacian-like operators.
    Here we show how an elliptic operator can be formulated to capture a general
    Mat\'ern-type correlation structure for practical use in variational data
    assimilation.
    We show how nonstationarity and anisotropy can be encoded into the operator
    via a simple change of variables based on user-defined
    normalization length scales.
    The change of variables defines a mapping between the computational domain
    and a space where the isotropic and stationary Mat\'ern correlation function
    applies.
    In addition to the mapping, two other hyperparameters \textit{separately}
    control the correlation length scale (i.e.\ range) and shape.
    As a practical use-case, we apply the correlation operator to a global ocean model.
    We show that when the normalizing length scales are chosen
    based on the local grid scale, the range parameter has an intuitive
    interpretation as the number of neighboring grid cells at which correlation drops to 0.14.
    Finally, the correlation model is additionally shown to be computationally efficient
    in two aspects.
    First,
    the required linear solve can be performed with a high tolerance  ($\sim$~$10^{-3}$)
    while still achieving the correct statistics, requiring relatively few
    iterations to converge.
    Secondly, the shape of the correlation function is determined by the number
    of times the operator is applied, but, owing to the generic Mat\'ern form,
    this also improves the diagonal dominance of the matrix form.
    Thus, it is shown that the model can actually be \textit{more} efficient with more
    applications of the inverse elliptic operator.
