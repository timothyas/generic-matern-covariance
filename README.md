# A Practical Gaussian Covariance Formulation for Applications with Anisotropic, Nonstationary, and Multivariate Fields

## Writing TODOs

- geophysical inverse problems to variational data assimilation ??
- possible abbreviations:
    - Lindgren 2011, WC01, MW10, WM13
    - Variational DA -> VDA
    - elliptic PDE, PDE, SPDE ,... etc


## After first draft totally done
- How to reference / use MITgcm figure
- Get the right MITgcm version and how to acknowledge in progress code...
- Rotation case... and add to methods: a subsection on extensions beyond the
  grid scale, a paragraph note about
  using the grid scale as a baseline, which could be extended by adding
  functions or using a rotation matrix ...
    - Add ECCO data citation correctly to references
- Actually make the supplemental material with dj and dk theoretical matern
  plots
