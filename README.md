# A Practical Gaussian Covariance Formulation for Applications with Anisotropic, Nonstationary, and Multivariate Fields

## Writing TODOs

- Edits:
    - [x] Patrick's comments
    - [x] Abstract efficiency: mention multi apps? Say this more generally?
    - [ ] Add Yaremchuk correlation functions
    - [ ] Add mention about how to handle MOM vertical coordinate?

- Reading considerations
    - [ ] geophysical inverse problems to variational data assimilation ??
    - [ ] possible abbreviations:
        - Lindgren 2011, WC01, MW10, WM13
        - Variational DA -> VDA
        - elliptic PDE, PDE, SPDE ,... etc

- Simple
    - [x] Add PH
    - [ ] Confirm with PH: affiliations and funding
    - [ ] Actually make the supplemental material document with dj and dk theoretical matern
      plots

- MITgcm stuff:
    - How to use MITgcm figure?
    - Make sure version is correct in citation...
    - Move updates to separate branch, make sure it works, cite it
- Make this repo public
    - Rename?
    - move relevant pych scripts here
    - clean up / organize
    - rosy pig ... public and rename
- Make datasets public, cite them in document
- QJRMS style
    - Template
    - Check figures, equations, etc...


## Extra
- Rotation case... and add to methods: a subsection on extensions beyond the
  grid scale, a paragraph note about
  using the grid scale as a baseline, which could be extended by adding
  functions or using a rotation matrix ...
    - Add ECCO data citation correctly to references
    - Add derivation to its own supplement, with some documentation on how the
      redi stuff didn't work
