# A Practical Gaussian Covariance Formulation for Applications with Anisotropic, Nonstationary, and Multivariate Fields

## Writing TODOs

- geophysical inverse problems to variational data assimilation ??
- possible abbreviations:
    - Lindgren 2011
    - Variational DA -> VDA
    - elliptic PDE, PDE, SPDE ,... etc
- Ide et al notation
- consistent capitalization
- people's names:
    - Weaver, A Weaver, A T Weaver
    - Griffies, S Griffies


### Review
- Statement about "matern field" is where the covariance analytical function
  holds ... but do I actually use that term?

### Methods
- Should discuss how we get random samples, and boundary conditions

### Results
- Fix Fig 4.1 to have correct legend
- figure out how to say all results are tol=1e-3

### Discussion
- In conclusions, note that time could additionally be handled as a separate
  dimension, and now "grid cells" has the interpretation of "time steps", once
  we normalize by deltat ... there are definitely other citations to mention
  here (some by the Lindgren et al crew)
- half laplacian? integer M?
- are longer correlation lengths due to zonal currents? probably ... want to
  extend this discussion?
