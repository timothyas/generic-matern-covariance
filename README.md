# A Practical Gaussian Covariance Formulation for Applications with Anisotropic, Nonstationary, and Multivariate Fields

## Writing TODOs

- geophysical inverse problems to variational data assimilation ??
- possible abbreviations:
    - Lindgren 2011, WC01, MW10, WM13
    - Variational DA -> VDA
    - elliptic PDE, PDE, SPDE ,... etc
- Ide et al notation
- normalizer ... X ... yeah maybe not ...
- references:
    - why TF is Purser 2003 a,b in this weird order

## Figures
- Legend to bottom panel of last fig
- Delta X -> Delta x in maps
- Actually make the supplemental material with dj and dk theoretical matern
  plots

### Review

### Methods
- Have a subsection on extensions beyond the grid scale, a paragraph note about
  using the grid scale as a baseline, which could be extended by adding
  functions or using a rotation matrix ...

### Results
- Could move legend of last fig into bottom panel

### Discussion
